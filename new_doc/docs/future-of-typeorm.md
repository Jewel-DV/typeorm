# The Future of TypeORM

## Our Vision for a Revitalized TypeORM

We're excited to share our vision for a revitalized TypeORMâ€”a strategy focused on building a stable, robust, and sustainable foundation for the long term.

### A New Beginning

TypeORM has become one of the most popular ORMs in the JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystem, serving thousands of developers and powering countless applications worldwide. However, with growth comes challenges, and we recognize the need for a more structured approach to maintenance and development.

### Our Commitment

We are committed to:

1. **Stability**: Focusing on fixing critical bugs and ensuring backward compatibility
2. **Documentation**: Improving and expanding our documentation to make TypeORM more accessible
3. **Community**: Building a stronger community of contributors and maintainers
4. **Sustainability**: Ensuring TypeORM thrives for years to come through sustainable development practices

### What's Coming

- **Regular maintenance releases**: Addressing bugs and performance issues
- **Improved documentation**: Complete overhaul of our docs with more examples and guides
- **Better testing**: Expanding our test coverage for greater reliability
- **Transparent roadmap**: Clear communication about priorities and upcoming features

### How You Can Help

TypeORM is an open-source project that thrives through community contributions. Here's how you can help:

- **Contribute code**: Fix bugs, add features, or improve documentation
- **Report issues**: Help us identify and reproduce bugs
- **Spread the word**: Share TypeORM with your network
- **Sponsor the project**: Financial support helps us dedicate more time to development

We're excited about this new chapter for TypeORM and grateful for your continued support.

Together, we'll build a stronger, more reliable ORM for everyone.
